# GodotBlackjack
Blackjack simulator in Godot. Currently a WIP, about 75% complete. This project is meant to be a foundation for a future project that I am making that uses cards and dice, where I can take a lot of the card logic here and put it into my dream game. I am also using this project to learn how to do things like manage state, game loop, global logic, etc.
