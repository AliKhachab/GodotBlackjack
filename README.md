# GodotBlackjack
A Blackjack simulator in Godot. 

The plan is to use this to make my first ever real game and learn how to use cards in Godot as a foundation for a "dream-game" I have planned in the future. As this is my first ever Godot project and my first ever game development project, I have learned the following things so far from this:
	- How to use composition more than inheritance to make more dynamic objects
	- Creating UIs
	- Managing scenes
	- Managing state universally
	- Using button assets (KennyNL's CC0 assets)
	- Etc.
	
And here are some things I want to learn and test with this project:
	- Sound mixing (i.e. using a card flip sound whenever a card is flipped over in tandem with having a master volume, music volume, sfx volume slider in the pause menu in the settings)
	- Natural delay (i.e. the dealer now plays the game correctly but the game runs too fast on the CPU and just ends before all the animations are done)
	- Maybe add some funny feature so it's not literally Blackjack (as a separate game -- the simulator is more of a testing ground)


As of right now, the full game works. As in, you can open the game, play a game of Blackjack, and go again or quit. I would like to add the above features mentioned so I can learn more about them and then be able to put out an actual real game with the skills I have.
