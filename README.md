# GodotBlackjack
A Blackjack simulator in Godot. 

(Please note that this project is not abandoned and I just have a lot of schoolwork to catch up on in order to graduate with straight As. The moment I'm free, I'm adding more to this project).

The plan is to use this to make my first ever real game and learn how to use cards in Godot as a foundation for a "dream-game" I have planned in the future. As this is my first ever Godot project and my first ever game development project, I have learned the following things so far from this:
	- How to use composition more than inheritance to make more dynamic objects
	- Creating UIs
	- Managing scenes
	- Managing state universally
	- Using button assets (KennyNL's CC0 assets)
	- Etc.
	
And here are some things I want to learn and test with this project:
	- Add music to the game (I've added other SFX to the game, I just need to find some CC0 music and learn how to use that to make music work in this game as it does in other games).
	- Maybe add some funny feature so it's not literally Blackjack (as a separate game -- the simulator is more of a testing ground)


As of right now, the full game works. As in, you can open the game, play a game of Blackjack, and go again or quit. I would like to add the above features mentioned so I can learn more about them and then be able to put out an actual real game with the skills I have.

Current things to fix/add:
	- I want to make the UI prettier lol it's just a PNG on the background
